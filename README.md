## Article:  [Single-nucleus proteomics identifies regulators of protein transport (Derks et al, 2024)](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/systems-biology)
&nbsp;

#### **Demonstrated aim:** This work demonstrated an approach to infer novel functional regulators from (sub-)single-cell proteomics data. Specifically, the natural proteomic and functional variability of THP-1 macrophage-like cells was used to identify regulators of LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. Cells were treated with LPS for short durations (10, 30, or 60 minutes) or left not-treated.
